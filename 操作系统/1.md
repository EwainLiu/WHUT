9.8
Consider a logical address space of eight pages of 1024 words each, mapped onto a physical
memory of 32 frames.
a. How many bits are there in the logical address?
b. How many bits are there in the physical address?

Ans:  
a. `$log_2 (8*1024) = 13$`
b. `$log_2 (32*1024) = 15$`

12.1 Consider a file currently consisting of 100 blocks. Assume that the file control block (and
the index block, in the case of indexed allocation) is already in memory. Calculate how
many disk I/O operations are required for contiguous, linked, and indexed (single-level)
allocation strategies, if, for one block, the following conditions hold. In the contiguousallocation case, assume that there is no room to grow in the beginning, but there is room to grow in the end. Assume that the block information to be added is stored in memory.  

a. The block is added at the beginning.
b. The block is added in the middle.
c. The block is added at the end.
d. The block is removed from the beginning.
e. The block is removed from the middle.
f. The block is removed from the end.

Ans:  
- | contiguous | linked | indexed
- | - | - | -
add at begin | 201 | 1 | 1
add in middle | 101 | 52 | 1
add at end | 1 | 102 | 1
remove from beginning | 198 | 1 | 0
remove from middle | 98 | 52 | 0
remove from end | 0 | 100 | 0
